# Intro

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the [ABC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)), and first released it in 1991.
