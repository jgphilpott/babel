# Intro

Assembly Language, sometimes abbreviated to ASM, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture.
