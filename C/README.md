# Intro

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in [assembly language](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/Assembly/README.md). Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
