# Intro

Haskell is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation. Designed for teaching, research and industrial application, Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features such as type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading. Haskell's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). It is named after logician [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry).
