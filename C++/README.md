# Intro

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) as an extension of the [C programming language](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/C/README.md), or **"C with Classes"**. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
