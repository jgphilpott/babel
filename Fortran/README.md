# Basic Info

**Name:** [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)

**Creator(s):** [John Backus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus)

**Date:** 1957

**Website:** [fortran-lang.org](https://fortran-lang.org)

# Intro

Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. It has been in use for over six decades in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, geophysics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.

Fortran needs to be compiled before execution. To compile a Fortran file called `file.f90` use the command `gfortran -o file file.f90`, then to run the output file use the command `./file`.

# Syntax

### [Variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_variables.htm)

Fortran variables need to be declared at the start of your program and then assigned a value. To declare a new variable you need to declare it's [type](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_data_types.htm) followed by a dubble colon `::` symbol and then it's name. The variables value can then be assigned with an `=` sign.

```
real :: pi
integer :: num

pi = 3.14
num = 42
```
