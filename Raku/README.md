# Intro

Raku is a member of the [Perl](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/Perl/README.md) family of programming languages. Formerly known as Perl 6, it was renamed in October 2019. Raku introduces elements of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl was not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Raku began in 2000.
