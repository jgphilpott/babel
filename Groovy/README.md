# Intro

Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of [Python](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/Python/README.md), [Ruby](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/Ruby/README.md), and [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform, is compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code and libraries. Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java's. Groovy supports closures, multiline strings, and expressions embedded in strings. Much of Groovy's power lies in its AST transformations, triggered through annotations.
