# Intro

Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth) as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is named in honour of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal).

Pascal became very successful in the 1970s, notably on the burgeoning minicomputer market. Compilers were also available for many microcomputers as the field emerged in the late 1970s. It was widely used as a teaching language in university-level programming courses in the 1980s, and also used in production settings for writing commercial software during the same period. It was displaced by the [C programming language](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/C/README.md) during the late 1980s and early 1990s as UNIX-based systems became popular, and especially with the release of [C++](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/C%2B%2B/README.md).
