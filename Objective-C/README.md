# Intro

Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. Originally developed by Tom Love and Brad Cox in the early 1980s, it was selected by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system. Objective-C was the standard programming language supported by Apple for developing macOS and iOS applications using their respective APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, until the introduction of [Swift](https://github.com/jgphilpott/babel/blob/main/Swift/README.md) in 2014.
